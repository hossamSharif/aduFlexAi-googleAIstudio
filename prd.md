# Educational Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable educational organizations to offer comprehensive online courses with flexible subscription models and payment options
- Provide manual evaluation-based examination system ensuring quality assessment and personalized feedback
- Create guest-friendly course discovery experience optimized for conversion with public course catalog
- Deliver Arabic-first platform with complete RTL support and native mobile experience via Ionic PWA
- Implement organization-based course management allowing structured educational content delivery
- Support both online (Stripe) and offline payment methods for accessibility across all markets
- Achieve 70% course completion rate through engaging content delivery and progress tracking
- Generate verified certificates post-evaluation to validate learner achievements

### Background Context
The educational technology sector currently lacks platforms that combine manual evaluation rigor with modern course delivery and flexible payment options. Most existing solutions either focus on automated testing (limiting assessment quality) or lack proper Arabic/RTL support for Middle Eastern markets. Educational organizations need a platform that maintains high assessment standards through manual evaluation while providing modern user experience across web and mobile devices. This PRD defines a comprehensive educational platform built as a monorepo using Ionic 7.2+ with Angular 19 and Express.js, delivering a unified PWA that serves as both a public course marketplace and a robust learning management system.

The solution emphasizes manual evaluation over automated scoring, ensuring educational quality through human assessment while leveraging modern web technologies for scalable content delivery and multi-language support with Arabic as the primary language.
